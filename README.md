Powtils is a web development tool kit or framework for freepascal (and delphi)

Currently work is being done to port these units to freepascal 3.0

The compiler used to compile right now is freepascal version 2.2.4

Many of the tools will also be ported to GoLang

Also working on some more examples:
* In the examples there is a wiki parser, this will be updated to be a wiki. As cross platform file sharing in FPC is now ready this helps make the wiki multi user (file locking).
* Polish up compile-studio (cthis program allows one to compile freepascal programs online in your browser using a server based compiler, just copy fpc compiler to your server cgi-bin in a folder and set correct permisssions, then you can use compiel studio on any shared web host or any server)
