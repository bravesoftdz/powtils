Static site generator made with Powtils. Generates plain html files.
Super secure:  plain html files cannot be hacked/cracked.
Like a wiki or a blog system but with no ability for people to hack URL
variables and other inputs

Comment posting system: this is not yet decided. Comments allow a website to be 
dyamically hacked, so basically are insecure. One option is just to have people 
"Reddit" your site (comment on your site at an external website). This indeed 
leads to websites being disjointed across more than one domain name, but there
lays the issue (or advantage!) with super secure sites.
