<h4>What's this?</h4>
This is a <b>simple</b> static site generator, but you can edit the static site online.  In other words you do not have to use ftp to upload your static site.
End users can see your plain html files after your pages are generated (plain html files are more secure than any dynamic web page that accesses code on the server)
