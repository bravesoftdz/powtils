<h4>What's this?</h4>
This is a <b>simple</b> static site generator, but you can edit the static site online.  In other words you do not have to use ftp to upload your static site.
End users can see your plain html files after your pages are generated (plain html files are more secure than any dynamic web page that accesses code on the server)

To edit the main page and make a static html page out of it, click Edit Page to the left.
To make a static html file out of any page, edit it or create a new page by linking to
it or accessing it in the url bar via the "p=SomeNewPage" url paramater.
