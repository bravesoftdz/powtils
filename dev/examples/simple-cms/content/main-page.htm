<h4>What's this???</h4>
This is a <b>simple</b> content management system using Powtils.
<p>
It allows you to enter raw HTML.
<p>
Create pages by linking to <a href="scms.cgi?p=Some-New-Page">Some New Page</a> or <a href="scms.cgi?p=Some-Other-Page">Some Other Page</a> or <a href="scms.cgi?p=Some-Other-New-Page">Yet Another Page</a>

<h4>Very simple!!!</h4>
Extend the CMS by downloading it and improving the sources, if you want to make it easier to use
(i.e. links like [this] or [[this]] have not been implemented in this simple demo, but wiki parser above does that).

<h4>Notes</h4>
Do not use BODY and HTML and HEAD tags. All your content will go inside the body.
