********************************************************************************

Version 1.7.1 of Powtils with SimpleCMS included
(previously known as Pascal Server Pages)

**All documentation may not be available yet for 1.7.X but is similar to 1.6.X**

This special release (SimpleCMS included) was tested to compile with fpc 3.0.0

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Introduction:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Powtils is a web utilities devel package for FPC/Delphi and possibly other
compilers in the future. The utilities focus on web programming and HTTP
related routines, data structures, and algorithms.

See the documentation and intro at:
 http://z505.com/powtils/idx.shtml
 http://z505.com/powtils/docs.shtml
 http://z505.com/cgi-bin/powtils/docs/1.6/idx.cgi?file=generalindex
 http://z505.com/cgi-bin/powtils/docs/1.6/idx.cgi?file=index

All standard servers such as cpanel/plesk/apache/other are supported.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Warning
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
FPC 2.0.4 contains buggy sockets unit on MS Windows!
Use FPC 2.2.0 or above if using http.pas/smtp.pas or anything sockets.pp related!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Delphi Tips
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 -Use the SYSUTILS_ON define because CompactSysutils will not work. It has been
  enabled in units,  but just incase you have a unit using compactsysutils, you
  should know this.
 -Delphi has slightly different syntax and APPTYPE CONSOLE requirements, some
  units may need fixing, but compatibility has been added lately!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Setup Instructions:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

COMPILER - FPC version 3.0.0 is what this release was tested on.

Inside pwmain you will see some comments about DEFINES which you can set with
your IDE or with fpc -d option. Gzip, verbose debugging, etc.

In 1.7.X is a new way of using sessions and config files. No more CFG_ON defines
or SESS_ON defines. Instead you use an Init unit in your uses clause.
See pwinit.pas, pwinitall, and examples/hello-world/ for details.


  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   IF USING PWMAIN.PAS
  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Just place pwinit and pwmain in your uses clause.
    1. Compile program
    2. Upload program to server in cgi bin directory
    3. Change permissions to 755 on unix (or check your hosting company!)
    4. if using config file (pwu_unix.conf or pwu_win.conf), upload.
       config file is optional, see pwinitall.pas

    Example program
    //................................................................//
    program mycgi;  {$apptype console}

    uses
      pwinit, // required !!
      pwmain; // main web functions

    begin
      webwrite('Hello!'); // old syntax
      out('Hello!');      // new syntax available
    end.
    //................................................................//


  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   IF USING DYNPWU.PAS
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    DYNPW.pas was not prepared for 1.7.X yet (DLL/DSO)


----------------------
Config file or not?
----------------------
You can choose.. If using a config file then enable it in your pwinit.pas unit.
Then place pwu_unix.conf or pwu_win.conf in your program directory, for example:

On UNIX like OS:
  /public_html/cgi-bin/test/pwu_unix.conf
  /www_root/cgi-bin/test/pwu_unix.conf

On Windows OS:
  c:\apache\www\cgi-bin\test\pwu_win.conf
  c:\program files\apache\www\cgi-bin\test\pwu_win.conf

   CGI-BIN Tips
   -------------
  It is recommended you work in a subdirectory from cgi-bin instead of directly
  in /cgi-bin/yourprog.cgi, in order to keep yourself better organized. Cgi
  programs work anywhere from cgi-bin/ including subdirectories.



---------------------------------------------------------------------------
About the /CGI-BIN/ directory and why it is your friend:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Even if you have a server that allows cgi programs to be executed outside of
/CGI-BIN/, it is recommended you stay in /CGI-BIN/. If you ever move to a new
server you will be very disappointed in the work it can take to restructure your
directories. If one server does not have the same set up as your old one, which
allowed access outside cgi-bin, you will be spending a lot of time restructuring
the directories and files. Server portability is an issue with any web language,
for example php.ini can cause php programmers trouble when moving to a server.

As long as you use CGI-BIN directory you are actually more scalable and more
portable with Powtils than if you had used PHP. Why - because with Powtils you
make your own config files - you do not rely on some hidden php.ini. You also
do not have php version conflicts (php 4 vs php 5) since your executable is
shipped in one nice deployable program.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Shortening cgi-bin urls with HTACCESS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If you would like to make it convenient for your web vistors to type in URL's,
and you don't like /cgi-bin/ in the URL, consider using htaccess if you are on
Apache, and doing some mod_rewrite rules for your URL's.

However, as all websites grow with time, it is usually not worth the effort to
try and make ALL your URL's short and sweet except in special circumstances:
Using too many htaccess tricks will slow very large sites down, too.

We recommend you read the documentation as it is much more thorough than this
readme file.
